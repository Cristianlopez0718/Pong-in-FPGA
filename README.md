# Pong-in-FPGA
Implemented a VGA controller to get a connection between a FPGA and a monitor. Begun the project by establishing static objects for the ball, paddle and the wall. Then took input from a switch to move the paddle up or down and changed the ball movement depending on the boundaries reached.
